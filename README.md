✈️ Flight Delay Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes flight delay patterns using cleaned airline data and interactive Power BI dashboards. The goal is to identify why flights are delayed, which airlines and routes are most affected, and how factors like seasonality, stops, and halt time contribute to delays.
The analysis focuses on April–June delays, especially in southern routes, where heavy monsoon weather significantly impacts airline operations.





🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

Power BI – Dashboarding & visualization

Power Query – Data transformation

DAX – KPI & calculated measures
Excel / CSV – Raw dataset



🌧 Root Cause Identified

Heavy monsoon weather in southern regions during April–June leads to operational slowdowns, longer halt times, and increased flight delays.





📊 Key KPIs Tracked

Total Flights

Total Revenue

Average Ticket Price

Total Late vs On-Time Flights

Percentage of Non-Stop Flights

Busiest Route & Flights Count

Average Delay Time (hours & minutes)

Average Halt Time at Stops





📈 Key Dashboard Insights
🕒 Delay Trends

Highest flight delays occur between April and June

Southern routes experience more delays due to monsoon weather conditions

Average delayed time peaks during May and June

🛫 Airline Performance

Air India & Jet Airways show the highest average delay and halt times

IndiGo & Air Asia perform better with lower delays and fewer stops

🗺 Route Analysis

DEL → BOM → COK is the busiest and most delayed route

Routes with multiple stops have significantly higher delays

Non-stop flights account for only ~33%, contributing to delay buildup

⏱ Stops & Halt Time Impact

Longer halt times directly correlate with higher delays

Airlines operating multi-stop routes face operational inefficiencies

🌦 Seasonal Insight (Critical Finding)

Flights are frequently delayed from April–June in southern India due to heavy monsoon rains, affecting runway operations, visibility, and turnaround times.





📌 Key Business Takeaways

Reducing stopovers can improve on-time performance

Seasonal scheduling adjustments are essential during monsoon months

Airlines should optimize ground operations on busy multi-stop routes
